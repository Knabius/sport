# Sport - Interval Exercise Tracker

A desktop interval timer and tracker for sports activities written in Rust. The graphical user interface is based on the [Slint](https://slint.dev/) framework. The app reminds the user to perform exercises at random intervals, alerts them with audio notifications, and cleanly logs progress across different profiles.

## ✨ Features

- **Interval Timer:** Set a minimum and maximum time interval. The app selects a random time within this interval and notifies you as soon as it's time for an exercise.
- **Audio Notifications:** Plays randomly selected MP3 sounds from a local directory when the timer expires.
- **Workout Tracking & Statistics:** Records completed repetitions, execution frequency (number of sets), and personal records (Max) for each exercise.
- **Data Visualization:** Evaluate your training data chronologically. View histories and progress flexibly filtered by year, month, week, or day.
- **User Profiles:** Supports multiple profiles. Each profile can have different active exercises.
- **Local Data Storage:** All logs, configurations, and statistics are stored locally and offline in customizable TOML and text files within the `resources/` folder.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Rust 🦀
- **GUI Framework:** [Slint](https://slint.dev/) (Uses `.slint` files for flexible UI design)
- **Audio:** `rodio` (For playing MP3 files)
- **Data Management:** `toml`, `toml_edit`, `chrono`
- **Randomness:** `rand`

## 🚀 Installation & Prerequisites

### Prerequisites
Since the project is developed in Rust, you need **Rust & Cargo** (see [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)).

### Directory Structure (`resources`)
For the application to start correctly, a folder named `resources` must be located next to the executable (or in the project root if executed via `cargo run`). It should have the following structure:

```text
sport/
├── src/
│   └── ...                 # Rust and Slint source code
├── resources/
│   ├── config.toml         # Basic settings, volume, profiles, and active exercises
│   ├── exercise_data.toml  # Cumulative statistics (Reps, Sets, Max)
│   ├── chronological_data.txt # Chronological log of each performed exercise
│   └── sounds/             # Folder for MP3 notification sounds (e.g., a gong)
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
```
*Note: Before starting the app for the first time, make sure there is at least one `.mp3` file in the `resources/sounds/` folder, otherwise the program might crash during playback.*

### Compile and Run
To start the project in development mode:
```bash
cargo run
```

For maximum performance and subsystem integration (`#![cfg_attr(target_os = "windows", windows_subsystem = "windows")]` hides the console on Windows):
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Customize Exercises & Profiles:** Go to the settings tab. There you can create/switch user profiles and add new exercises or toggle them for the current profile.
2. **Start Timer:** Define your interval on the main view. Click on Start.
3. **Complete Exercise:** After the timer expires, you will hear a sound and an exercise will be assigned to you. Enter the number of completed repetitions and confirm.
4. **Visualization (Statistics):** Use the visualization section to view your progress in various exercises over defined periods (like the last 30 days) using dropdowns.
